        <p style="font-size: large;position:relative; top: 40px ;font-size: 17px;">From a 150 sq.ft store in Pune to being one of Puneâ€™s leading Jewellery brands with over 12 sprawling stores all over the city, Chrysallis Jewellers has left behind a golden trail. Our journey that began in 2024 was later re-established by Shri Rishi More with a vision to give people authentic jewellery that is not just elegant, but in fact a class apart, along with uncompromising quality and delicate craftsmanship. This flourishing business is now steered meticulously by the sixth generation of the family. Following in the footsteps is Mr.Arya Bangale (Partner), who currently manages the Pimpri Chinchwad store and primarily focuses on taking this rich legacy forward. Over 143 years into the business, we have succeeded in overcoming various obstacles and our presence in the Indian market has been marked by a number of firsts. We have expanded our variety from just gold and silver to even platinum and diamonds. Over the years, we have earned a distinct and dependable name and have emerged as the Pioneers in the jewellery business in the Western</p>
